1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,140
Hated everyone.

2
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:04,230
And welcome to the front and double dip or boot camp.

3
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:09,690
So you're already into the course or maybe you are looking just at the free preview to see and check

4
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:12,170
out what are the projects that we are going to build up.

5
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:15,880
So the good news is we are going to build a whole lot of projects.

6
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:21,210
But before I show you all of the projects that we are going to work up and code along in this entire

7
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:27,270
coast Let me just be clear on one point that these are not only the projects which on which we are going

8
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:28,370
to be working.

9
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:34,310
There are a whole set of other projects which we haven't taken into account because they are small and

10
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,970
we just don't want to bother about them.

11
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:39,580
But yes we do have many other projects as well.

12
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:40,180
OK.

13
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:45,350
So in case you're wondering why I'm looking at the very top out there the screen is gigantic and camera

14
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:46,830
is long at the top.

15
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:52,180
So before further ado let me talk about these projects that we are going to work up.

16
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:53,590
And these are really good.

17
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:59,160
And in this whole package where we're going to start with HDMI elsea says this is a step by step process

18
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:04,400
out there so HD is says bootstrap javascript J.A.G. and finally project.

19
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,420
Everything is going to be in the steps.

20
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:12,100
But on every step we are going to just test those skills by designing a project out there.

21
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,660
So let's just talk about that.

22
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:18,570
So here you can see the very first project that we are going to build up is Fitow for Jim.

23
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:23,280
So this is the gym coming soon template and it looks really it looks really great.

24
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:28,320
And this is going to be your first project out there and again remember that this is irresponsive right

25
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:28,750
now.

26
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:30,120
We just try to make it.

27
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:32,630
And this is a pure HVM and nothing else.

28
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:36,990
And thereafter we will move ahead and talk about these kinds of things as well.

29
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:44,070
So this is a sushi restaurant coming soon template with this template utilizes the extremal five things

30
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:47,010
about the videos and there is a back end video as well.

31
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:54,840
Again everything is again responsive without using any of the Wordpress are any but any things like

32
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,290
bootstrap and things like that.

33
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:57,690
But again it's really good.

34
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:03,090
So this is going to be project number two and there is a whole lot of separate movies dedicated with

35
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:05,990
the name of the project that you can check out for these.

36
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:12,390
And thereafter we are going to build a tacky truck non-responsive Web site in order to get an idea how

37
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:17,670
responsive are good and how easy it is nowadays to code at a sponsored web site.

38
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:22,680
We're going to talk about how the non-responsive upside used to look like and still there are a lot

39
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:27,360
of corporate sectors and a lot of companies who are still having these Web sites just like this.

40
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:33,290
So we're going to talk about this again just as I togged this is non-responses so doesn't respond to

41
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:34,590
the my size out there.

42
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:36,500
So this is one part.

43
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:37,550
OK.

44
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:42,960
Taqi truck is good and there are a couple of challenges in the truck as well to make sure that you understand

45
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:45,000
how the templates are being edited.

46
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:49,860
One of the most important part of your day to day life job as the front end of our build up here will

47
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:53,080
be to edit the templates for the clients or maybe for your company.

48
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,480
So we'll be tackling that as well.

49
00:02:55,650 --> 00:03:02,940
Further we will be moving on the To Do list app on this To-Do list app is actually built totally in

50
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:06,820
the CSX and the HDMI.

51
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,080
Nothing no jealousy at all but still look at this.

52
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:15,660
This goes out there and everything is being scratched and Maag and great but again everything is being

53
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:16,520
done in HD.

54
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:24,300
Mullins see SS moving further on we are going to build up this technical landing page and this is responsive

55
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,410
and a lot of things are happening here.

56
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:29,600
And we will also learn how the media query works out there.

57
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:33,720
So notice as this blue bar out there is going to turn into the green.

58
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:34,850
So there we go.

59
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:40,110
And there we go it turns into the green and here we are going to learn about the media queries how the

60
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:44,970
media queries are responsible for a completely different CSSA So there we go we are going to talk about

61
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:45,610
this.

62
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:50,720
And in case you haven't noticed look at the top menu bar the hamburger bar appears out there.

63
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,040
And there we go.

64
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:56,670
And one more thing in this we are going to do is we are going to look up for how these buttons are being

65
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:57,220
placed.

66
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:01,840
So these Facebook and Twitter button are also being policed as a project out there.

67
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:07,250
So we are going to talk about that as well in a separate project and we have many projects you might

68
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:08,130
see out there.

69
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:13,980
And thereafter we are going to move on to a completely different web page project and its a complete

70
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:18,510
full fledged application that you can utilize for maybe your client or your personal use.

71
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:25,030
And I think all of these project in these into our course along with images do come with a license of

72
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:26,920
feel free whatever you want to do with that.

73
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:31,950
Even commercially non-commercially whatever you want to fish in case you haven't noticed.

74
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:35,040
Let me just reload and watch this boy's photo out there.

75
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:36,880
It's a wobbly wobbly photo.

76
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,370
So we're going to learn how we can.

77
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:43,740
And he made these things and can apply these kinds of cool effects now after this section we have a

78
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:48,320
very good navigation section image and some content.

79
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:50,550
Again content image image content.

80
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:56,220
So we'll be flipping that all and we'll see how the editors help us to just copy and paste and replace

81
00:04:56,220 --> 00:05:01,430
the things out there so this is really great after that try to sell the Yahoo.

82
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:04,930
I know it's already being sold but still we're going to try with this.

83
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:06,840
Nobody is going to buy Yahoo with this page.

84
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:10,160
But these bage are really popular as a landing page.

85
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:15,670
So what you can do you can just buy today selling some items put some items or images out there and

86
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:18,150
people can buy from these kinds of landing pages.

87
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:23,200
So this is really essential for every front end developer for their moving.

88
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,370
We do have an admin dashboard Yes.

89
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,580
Admin do have front ends as well.

90
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:34,600
Later on we are people just move out there and put some BHB maybe know Jesus or javascript's and things

91
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:40,600
like that onto these templates but his admin dashboard are also a part of a front end development so

92
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,890
people like to just give it as it go.

93
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:43,810
So there we go.

94
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:49,270
We do have a simple template of that dashboard notice all the font icons font or some icons are being

95
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:52,870
placed out there and add users categories.

96
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:59,110
These labels some bars out there many bar side bars and the table is there the detail table which is

97
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:02,560
usually populated by the HB or some backend scripts.

98
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:05,500
But this is just different and moving further.

99
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,360
We do have a random parser generator.

100
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:12,820
So by now you might have already learned the javascript and thereafter we're going to learn about these

101
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:13,360
things.

102
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:17,590
So this is a random password generator do you just enter whatever the length of the password you need.

103
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:23,330
Let's just say 8 click on the generate password every time it just generates a random password.

104
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:27,900
So we're going to have a look on how these things works and look how cool it is looking.

105
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:35,290
And after that we are going to move on to our simple clock ticking clock which is actually looks really

106
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:36,910
boring but it's really impressive.

107
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:41,050
The background color of the page actually changes based on the time.

108
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:45,060
So these are the hex values so R G B.

109
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:51,970
If I'll stay on this page for a few seconds you will notice this now that the colors do change slightly

110
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:58,240
or so we will learn how we can tackle that and this clock just sticks out and doesn't consume much of

111
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,550
the memory out there as well.

112
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:06,250
Finally let's move on to this guy and and thereafter we learn some of the queer defects as well.

113
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:09,110
So after learning that Jake really we'll be talking here as well.

114
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:15,850
So you will learn how this effect is being applied so you can just place two images under there can

115
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:21,160
be a slight it out there of seeing the effect before and after a lot of people do are restoring works

116
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,880
out there making all things good and are dead.

117
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:28,410
So recently I happened to tackle these kinds of projects and I've found this crazy plug in.

118
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,850
And we will learn how we can utilize that and we will learn how we can do that.

119
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:34,650
So previously it looked like that.

120
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:36,100
And then we made it look like that.

121
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:39,110
So these kinds of things are really handy out there.

122
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,680
Thereafter we will move on and look for the type ahead.

123
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,480
Now you might have seen that in Google or maybe in the twitter or everything.

124
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:49,110
So let's just say this is a state of USA.

125
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:52,390
And again notice there's a challenge here for the student as well.

126
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:55,280
So let say I am looking for the New York or something.

127
00:07:55,420 --> 00:08:00,910
So as I type the new so New Jersey New Mexico is also being suggested as the as I type.

128
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:07,840
And again as I move to the lead just say I'm moving for the Arizona as I type A are automatically based

129
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:13,970
on that the search is being modified so charm of J queries being implemented here.

130
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:17,100
And the challenge here is really simple for the students.

131
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:19,690
But we'll talk about that challenge later on.

132
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:20,510
OK.

133
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:26,830
And finally a final project that will be building up is going to be this Bristowe coffee and it will

134
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:30,670
implement all of the things HVM bootstraps see javascript.

135
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:35,650
Jake ready animations parallax pretty much everything that we have learned is going to be implemented

136
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:36,160
here.

137
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:43,000
And we can see that this Bristo coffee is keep jumping but do notice this and a little more some time

138
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,460
button as I reload this get severe believably effect out there as well.

139
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:51,840
So this is what we're going to be doing some servers section three columns here.

140
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:57,660
And then the portfolio Web site some nice neat images are being placed here.

141
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:01,210
And artists do notice the parallax effect that we have implemented here.

142
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:07,420
This is a parallax effect and Feliks is so easy to implement out there and we're going to talk about

143
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:08,450
that as well.

144
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:12,610
Here we have implemented that do not is this be a part of our team again.

145
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:18,750
Wibbly Wobbly the kind of effect that we will implement are there and some amazing team we do have Mark

146
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:22,180
John and Peter three little kids doing a lot of jobs.

147
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:28,090
Wibbly Wobbly here and there and we're going to learn and they're off to notice the Perlitz and the

148
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,060
some code would look great here.

149
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:35,000
Very tiny but still giving a little glance too over perfection out there.

150
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:37,010
I noticed this is a parallax effect.

151
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:43,420
And there we go finally we have a contact form are there and all of these images and pretty much everything

152
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:47,590
are just open source so just feel free to do whatever you want to do with them.

153
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:52,900
So these are all the project overview that we are going to building up and all these projects are going

154
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:55,120
to get started from the very scratch.

155
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:56,630
No problem at all.

156
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:58,890
Not be copy and pasting the code.

157
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:00,980
I'll be writing what's in front of you.

158
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:02,950
But again everything is being polished.

159
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:08,350
You will not see any blunders or things like that or Sanaz and a lot of hours are thinking's nothing

160
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:09,040
that.

161
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:15,400
And let's just go ahead and try to make these projects once we take out the theoretical part and some

162
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,950
writing code challenges as well.

163
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:19,780
So see are there in the next movie.
