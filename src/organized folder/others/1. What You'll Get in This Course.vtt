So it doesn't matter if you've never programmed before.

00:40.510 --> 00:46.660
Because I'm going to start at the beginning and I'll take you step by step so that you understand every

00:46.660 --> 00:52.540
single line of code that we write together we'll be covering some of the latest tools and technology

00:52.780 --> 01:00.400
including HELOC access javascript longer D-B express Jasp and a whole lot more.

01:00.750 --> 01:06.880
As a student on this course you're going to be saving yourself a lot of time because instead of having

01:06.880 --> 01:15.220

which is going to take you from beginner to mastery.

01:19.100 --> 01:25.120

or spend tens of thousands of dollars on an in-person programming bootcamp You'll get access to exactly

01:32.560 --> 01:39.070
the same content when you get to do it in your own time and on your own terms for a fraction of the

01:39.070 --> 01:39.970
price.

01:40.270 --> 01:46.650
By the end of the course you will be fluently programming by yourself and along the way you will have
